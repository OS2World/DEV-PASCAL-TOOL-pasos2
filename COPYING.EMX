THERE IS NO WARRANTY!

    No guarantee is made as to the proper functioning of the software.
    No liability will be admitted for damage resulting from using the
    software.

Copying the emx development package:

    You are allowed to copy the complete and unmodified emx package
    (emxdev.zip, emxlib.zip, emxample.zip, emxtest.zip) if this is
    done without charge.  If you want to charge a small fee for
    handling etc., you have to contact the author.  If you want to
    charge a big fee, you aren't allowed to copy the emx development
    package.  The emxomf, emxomfar, emxomfld and listomf programs are
    exceptions: the GNU General Public License (see COPYING) applies
    to these programs if distributed separately from the emx
    development package.

Copying the emx runtime package:

    Everybody is allowed to use the emx runtime package.  You are
    allowed to copy the unmodified emx runtime package if you do not
    charge for the distribution.

    If you take money for a program you've developed with emx (or for
    emx), a complimentary copy would be appreciated by the emx
    author.

    If you donate a complimentary copy of your program to the emx
    author you are allowed to accompany that program with those
    (unmodified) parts (emx.exe, emxbind.exe, emx.dll emxio.dll,
    emxlibc.dll, emxwrap.dll and emxrev.cmd) of the emx runtime
    package which are required by that program.  Moreover, in that
    case you are allowed to copy the relevant sections of emxrt.doc
    into the documentation of your program.

    (To avoid emx.dll, use the -Zomf -Zsys options of GCC.)

    In any case, you are allowed to use the emx C library (including
    libsys), the emx graphics library and the emx video library for
    your programs, without restriction.  If you've modified
    emxwrap.dll or emxlibc.dll, you should rename these files (to
    avoid problems with other programs using emxwrap.dll or
    emxlibc.dll) and include source code for the changed parts.

Copying the emx library sources (emx C library, emx graphics library
and emx video library):

    You must not take money for the emx library sources.  You are
    allowed to change and copy the emx library sources if you keep the
    copyright message intact.  If you improve the emx libraries,
    please send your enhancements to the emx author (you should
    copyright your enhancements similar to the existing emx
    libraries).
