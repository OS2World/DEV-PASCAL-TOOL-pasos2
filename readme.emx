Welcome to emx 0.8g, a common environment for creating 32-bit programs
for OS/2 2.0 and DOS.  You can use the GNU C compiler to compile
programs for emx.  The main design goal of emx is to simplify porting
Unix software to OS/2 2.0 and DOS.  Moreover, you can create `native'
OS/2 programs, including Presentation Manager applications.

The emx package includes:

- emx.dll and emxio.dll dynamic link libraries for OS/2 2.0

- emx.exe DOS extender for running 32-bit programs under DOS

- emxbind.exe for creating .exe files which work both under OS/2 2.0
  and DOS

- emxomf.exe for converting .o object files (a.out) to .obj object
  files (OMF).  With emxomf and LINK386 you can create OS/2 programs
  that don't need emx.dll

- C header files and a nearly complete C library with source

- a simple graphics library for 320x200 (256 colors) mode, with source

- a library for screen output in windows, with source

Additionally, the following GNU programs are available compiled and with
patches and sources (note that these files are not part of emx):

- GCC 2.4.5 the GNU C compiler (requires a 387 coprocessor under
  MS-DOS!)

- GAS 1.38.1, the GNU assembler

- GDB 4.9, the GNU debugger

- ld, the GNU linker

- ar, nm, size, strip, objdump: some GNU utilities for dealing with
  binary files

- texinfo, the GNU documentation system

- Patches for the GNU sources

- Patched source for GCC, GAS, GDB, ld, ar, nm, size, strip, objdump,
  info, makeinfo, texindex.  You can compile all these programs with
  the files that come with emx (but you also need a make utility, such
  as NMAKE).

- BSD curses library

You can get the complete GNU sources by anonymous ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu and other archives, for instance ftp.uni-stuttgart.de.
