Welcome to emx 0.8g, an environment for creating 32-bit programs for
OS/2 2.0 (and DOS).  You can use the GNU C compiler for compiling
programs.

To use the GNU C compiler with emx, you need at least

  emxrt.zip     emx runtime package

  emxdev.zip    files required for developing programs with emx

  gnudev.zip    the GNU C compiler, the GNU debugger, and other tools
                (it should also be possible to use a different C compiler;
                in fact I first used the Xenix386 C compiler)

  gppdev.zip    additional files for GCC required for compiling C++
                programs

  gobjcdev.zip  additional files for GCC required for compiling
                programs written in the Objective C language

and

  unzip.exe     a free program for unpacking ZIP files

The following packages are optional:

  emxview.zip   emx documentation in OS/2 .inf format
  emxlib.zip    emx library sources
  emxsrc1.zip   source for emxomf, emxomfar and emxomfld
  emxample.zip  sample programs
  emxtest.zip   test programs (used for testing emx and the libraries)
  gnuview.zip   gnudev.inf (gnudev.doc in OS/2 .inf format)
  gnudoc.zip    documentation for GNU programs (texinfo sources)
  gnuinfo.zip   GNU texinfo (includes info file browser)
  gnupat.zip    patches for GNU sources
  gnusrc.zip    patched GNU sources (ld, ar, nm, size, strip, objdump,
                termcap)
  gccsrc1.zip   patched GNU sources (gcc 2.4.5, part 1)
  gccsrc2.zip   patched GNU sources (gcc 2.4.5, part 2)
  gccsrc3.zip   patched GNU sources (gcc 2.4.5, part 3)
  gassrc.zip    patched GNU sources (gas 1.38.1)
  gdbsrc.zip    patched GNU sources (gdb 4.9)
  gppsrc.zip    patched sources of libg++ 2.2
  bsddev.zip    BSD libraries (curses etc.)
  bsddoc.zip    documentation for BSD libraries
  bsdsrc.zip    source for BSD libraries

You should install all the packages on the same drive.  For instance,
use

  c:
  cd \
  unzip emxrt

to install the emxrt.zip package on drive C:.  PKUNZIP cannot be
used.  All the files will be installed in the \emx subdirectory or in
subdirectories thereof.  The other packages are installed the same
way.

IMPORTANT!  If there's an older version of emx already installed, you
should delete the old version or rename the old directory.  Installing
a new version over an old version is NOT RECOMMENDED.  For instance,
the omflib batch file (see below) won't build new versions of the
libraries if the .lib files already exist.  That is, you would
continue to use the .lib files of the previously installed emx
version.

After unpacking the emx runtime and development system packages,
you'll find further information in the following files:

  \emx\doc\COPYING.EMX          emx & library license
  \emx\doc\COPYING              GNU General Public License
  \emx\doc\install.doc          Installation guide
  \emx\doc\emxrt.doc            User's guide to the emx runtime package
  \emx\doc\emxdev.doc           Application developer's guide
  \emx\doc\libref.doc           C library reference
  \emx\doc\build.doc            Compiling the GNU sources
  \emx\doc\history.doc          Change log
  \emx\doc\future.doc           Things to do
  \emx\book\emxrt.inf           .inf version of emxrt.doc
  \emx\book\emxdev.inf          .inf version of emxdev.doc (optional)
  \emx\book\libref.inf          .inf version of libref.doc (optional)

After unpacking the GNU and BSD packages, you'll find further
information in the following files:

  \emx\doc\COPYING              GNU General Public License
  \emx\doc\COPYING.LIB          GNU Library General Public License
  \emx\doc\COPYING.BSD          BSD license (for libbsd and libcurse)
  \emx\doc\gnudev.doc           GNU development tools information
  \emx\doc\bsddev.doc           BSD library information
  \emx\book\gnudev.inf          .inf version of gnudev.doc (optional)


Read history.doc first.

If you want to develop programs on a drive different from the drive
where emx is installed, you have to set the C_INCLUDE_PATH and
LIBRARY_PATH environment variables, for instance,

    set C_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/emx/include
    set LIBRARY_PATH=c:/emx/lib

If you want to compile C++ programs, set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH as well:

    set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/emx/include.cpp;c:/emx/include

The genclass utility needs the following environment variable:

    set PROTODIR=c:/emx/include.cpp/gen

If you want to compile programs written in the Objective C language,
set OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH as well:

    set OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/emx/include

To use GDB (the GNU debugger) and info (the GNU info browser) and other
programs that use termcap, set the TERM and TERMCAP environment
variables:

    set TERM=mono
    set TERMCAP=c:/emx/etc/termcap.dat

Set the INFOPATH environment variable for info:

    set INFOPATH=c:/emx/info

To use the emx documentation in OS/2 .inf format, append c:\emx\book
to the BOOKSHELF environment variable and define an environment
variable which tells VIEW how to concatenate the .inf files.  Example:

    set BOOKSHELF=C:\OS2\BOOK;C:\EMX\BOOK
    set EMXDOC=emxdev+libref+gnudev

To use the .inf files with EPM (the OS/2 Enhanced Editor), add the
following line to your config.sys file:

    set HELPNDX=emxdoc.ndx

If HELPNDX is already set in your config.sys file, add emxdoc.ndx
to the end of the HELPNDX variable, separated by a + character.
Moreover, you should add c:\emx\book to the DPATH environment
variable:

    set DPATH=...;c:\emx\book

where ... is the previous value of DPATH.

OS/2 users should set the environment variables in config.sys, DOS
users should set the environment variables in autoexec.bat.  Beware of
blanks at the end of the lines!

Some of the emx batch files (such as texi2dvi.cmd) require REXX to be
installed.  If you haven't installed REXX, use Selective Install to
install it.  (Note to DOS users: REXX is OS/2's batch file language.)

To finish the installation, add c:\emx\bin (insert the correct drive
letter) to your PATH.  Add c:\emx\dll (insert the correct drive
letter) to the LIBPATH statement in your config.sys file.  Reboot your
computer to enable the new LIBPATH statement and the new environment
variables.

To create the OMF libraries (for linking with LINK386), type the
following commands after installing emx:

    cd \emx\lib
    omflib

The omflib batch file builds .lib files from .a files.  Already
existing .lib files are not rebuilt.  If you install (after running
omflib) a package containing additional .a files , you should run
omflib again to build the .lib files for the new package.

If OS/2 says

    SYS1804: The system cannot find the file EMX.

when running a program compiled for emx, you haven't set LIBPATH
correctly.


Compiling a sample program
--------------------------

Install the emxample.zip package:

  c:
  cd \
  unzip emxample

Compile the sieve program (optimizer enabled):

  cd \emx\samples
  gcc -O2 -o sieve.exe sieve.c

Run the sieve program:

  sieve
  sieve 100000
  sieve -p 100


Sample debugging session
------------------------

Compile the sieve program for debugging:

  cd \emx\samples
  gcc -g -o sieve.exe sieve.c

Start the debugger and step through some lines:

  [D:\EMX\TEST]gdb sieve.exe

Viewing OS/2 .inf files
-----------------------

If you've installed the optional emxview.zip and gnuview.zip packages,
you can use the OS/2 VIEW utility to view a hypertext version of
emxdev.doc, libref.doc and gnudev.doc.  If you've added c:\emx\book to
the BOOKSHELF environment variable and defined the EMXDOC environment
variable (see above), type

    view emxdoc

to view the concatenated .inf files.  To get help for, say, printf(),
type

    view emxdoc printf

If you haven't set the environment variables, type

    view c:\emx\book\emxdev

to view emxdev.inf or type

    view c:\emx\book\emxdev+c:\emx\book\libref+c:\emx\book\gnudev

to view all the .inf files.

If you've properly set the HELPNDX and DPATH environment variables,
you can use the kwhelp (Ctrl-H) command of EPM to get on-line help for
the function at the cursor.  With emxdoc.ndx, all three books are
required to be installed.  If you haven't installed all the books, use
a subset of emxdev.ndx, libref.ndx and gnudev.ndx in the HELPNDX
environment variable.

emxdoc.ndx contains all entries of emxdev.ndx, libref.ndx and
gnudev.ndx, pointing to emxdoc.  Setting the EMXDOC environment
variable as explained above causes the three books to be concatenated
and named emxdoc.


Viewing the GNU on-line manuals
-------------------------------

To view the GCC and GDB manuals, unpack gnudoc.zip and gnuinfo.zip and
install info (see install.doc).  Use GNU makeinfo to create info files
for on-line help from the texinfo files.  makeinf.bat and makeinf.cmd
are batch files which simplify calling makeinfo.

To create info files for the GCC manual, type:

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makeinf gcc
  makeinf cpp

To create info files for the GDB manual, type:

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makeinf gdb

To create info files for the texinfo manual, type:

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makeinf texi
  makeinf makeinfo

To create info files for libg++, type:

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makeinf libgpp
  makeinf iostream

After creating the info files, you can use GNU info (see gnudev.doc
for details) or GNU Emacs to view the info files.


Printing the GNU manuals
------------------------

To print the manuals, you have to unpack gnudoc.zip and gnuinfo.zip.
Additionally, you have to install TeX.  Of course, I recommend emTeX,
which can be used both under OS/2 and DOS.  emTeX is available for
anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de   [129.69.1.12]: /soft/tex/systems/msdos/emtex
  ftp.tex.ac.uk        [134.151.44.19]: /pub/archive/systems/msdos/emtex
  ftp.shsu.edu         [192.92.115.10]: /tex-archive/systems/msdos/emtex
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]: /pub/comp/os/os2/emTeX

The following instructions assume that you're using emTeX (with
emTeX386).

To typeset the GCC documentation, type

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makedvi gcc

This creates the following files:

  cpp.dvi        GNU C preprocessor manual
  gcc.dvi        GNU C compiler manual

To typeset the GDB documentation, type

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makedvi gdb

This creates the following files:

  refcard.dvi    GDB reference card
  gdb.dvi        GDB manual

To typeset internal GDB documentation (you don't need this unless you
want to hack GDB), type

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makedvi gdbint

This create the following files:

  gdbint.dvi     GDB internals
  stabs.dvi      Description of debugging information format

To typeset the texinfo documentation, type

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makedvi texinfo

This creates the following files:

  texi.dvi       texinfo manual
  makeinfo.dvi   makeinfo manual

To typeset the libg++ documentation, type

  cd \emx\gnu\doc
  makedvi libgpp
  makedvi iostream

This creates the following files:

  libgpp.dvi     libg++ manual
  iostream.dvi   iostream manual
